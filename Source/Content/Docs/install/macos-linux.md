# macOS / Linux: Install

Everything below also works on Windows if you have Git Bash, WSL, or MSYS -
these are all POSIX shell scripts. If you're on native PowerShell, use
[Windows install](/docs/install/windows/) instead - `download.ps1` is the direct
PowerShell equivalent of `download.sh`.

## Option 1: Hermes plugin + explicit setup (recommended for most users)

The plugin is a pure loader: it does **not** bundle the binary or the dylib.
`download.sh` lives inside the plugin and fetches them from GitHub Releases
into the canonical runtime home `~/.hermes/aphrodite/binaries/` - never into
the plugin directory.

**Or skip the clone entirely:** the plugin is in the Hermes plugin catalog.
`hermes plugins install aphrodite` checks out the catalog entry's reviewed,
pinned commit (answer yes at the `Enable now?` prompt, or run
`hermes plugins enable aphrodite`), then `bash download.sh` from
`~/.hermes/plugins/aphrodite` fetches the binaries as below - the catalog
manages the install directory, so never run `aphrodite setup` against it.
The install mechanics are in
[the Hermes plugin guide](https://hermes-agent.nousresearch.com/docs/user-guide/features/plugins/).

```bash
git clone https://github.com/PlayForm/Aphrodite-Hermes.git
ln -s "$(pwd)/Aphrodite-Hermes" ~/.hermes/plugins/aphrodite
hermes plugins enable aphrodite
hermes
```

The plugin **never downloads**: `register()` only checks
`~/.hermes/aphrodite/binaries/` and logs the setup command if something is
missing. Run `download.sh` yourself as the explicit setup step (SHA-256
verified against the in-tree `SHA256SUMS.txt`, magic-byte checked):

```bash
cd ~/.hermes/plugins/aphrodite # your plugin clone
bash download.sh               # auto-detects version + platform
```

`download.sh` resolves the version automatically (the bundled
`BINARY_VERSION` file, the monorepo's own Cargo.toml, or the latest
published release) and detects your platform too - no Rust toolchain
needed. You can pin both explicitly:
`bash download.sh 1.6.5 x86_64-unknown-linux-gnu`. If the proxy never comes
up, see [Troubleshooting](/docs/install/troubleshooting/#proxy-doesnt-auto-launch).

## Option 2: `cargo install` + `aphrodite setup`

If you have a Rust toolchain, `aphrodite setup` provisions the binary,
dylibs, and `aphrodite.toml` under `~/.hermes/aphrodite/`, writes the
hooks-only loader (`plugin.yaml` + `__init__.py`) into
`~/.hermes/plugins/aphrodite/`, and registers the plugin with Hermes. The
two options are alternatives - git clone OR cargo install, you don't need
both.

```bash
cargo install aphrodite
aphrodite setup --api-key sk-... --api-url https://api.deepseek.com --model deepseek-v4-pro
```

No manual link step: setup writes the hooks-only loader directly into
`~/.hermes/plugins/aphrodite/` (removing any stale symlink from older
installs). That directory is hooks-only - the plugin never writes,
downloads, or modifies anything inside it; every runtime artifact (binaries,
config, directives, CCR state, logs) lives in `~/.hermes/aphrodite/`. By
default setup ends by starting the proxy; pass `--no-launch` to skip that.

What `aphrodite setup` does, in order:

| 5    | Writes `~/.hermes/aphrodite/aphrodite.toml` from an embedded template (`--cache-port`/`--token-port`, defaults `9797`/`9798`) - only if none exists, unless you pass `--force`.

| 8    | Runs `hermes plugins enable aphrodite` - a failed registration prints a warning, it does not abort                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                        |

Useful flags: `--cache-port`/`--token-port` (run multiple concurrent Hermes
Agents on one machine, each pointed at its own port pair), `--no-launch`
(skip auto-starting the proxy after setup), `--force` (rewrite an existing
`aphrodite.toml`; the binary, dylibs, loader, and version pin are always
refreshed on re-run regardless).

### macOS Gatekeeper handling

On macOS, every artifact copy in `aphrodite setup` (binary, dylibs, and the
`target/release` dev-build fallback) goes through one Gatekeeper-safe path:
`ditto` (metadata-preserving copy), falling back to `fs::copy` + `xattr -c`
(clear quarantine), then `install_name_tool -id @rpath/<name>` and an
explicit ad-hoc `codesign -f -s -` re-sign for dylibs. Every step that fails
prints a specific warning instead of being silently swallowed - a machine
missing Xcode Command Line Tools previously got a Gatekeeper-SIGKILLed binary
with zero diagnostic, and a failed `ditto` used to be treated as success.

## Option 3: From source (monorepo, full dev setup)

```bash
git clone https://github.com/PlayForm/Aphrodite.git
cd Aphrodite
git submodule update --init --recursive # required - vendored deps live in submodules
cargo build --release -p aphrodite -p aphrodite-hermes
# Binary: target/release/aphrodite
# Dylibs: target/release/libaphrodite.dylib, target/release/libaphrodite_hermes.dylib (or .so on Linux)
```

Then either:

| Approach                      | What it does                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                      |
| ----------------------------- | --------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| Let the plugin install itself | Build the crates, then enable the plugin - installation is manual: point `APHRODITE_BINARY_PATH`/`APHRODITE_HERMES_DYLIB_PATH` at your `target/{debug,release}/` build output, or copy it into the runtime home's `binaries/`; there is no separate installer script (layout_check is report-only and never modifies the install) |
| Wire things up manually       | Symlink the plugin directory yourself, then point `APHRODITE_BINARY_PATH`/`APHRODITE_HERMES_DYLIB_PATH` at your `target/{debug,release}/` build output instead of copying files around                                                                                                                                            |

## What changes after any of these

```
~/.hermes/
├── plugins/
│   └── aphrodite/          ← hooks-only: plugin.yaml + __init__.py loader (registers hooks/tools)
└── aphrodite/              ← canonical runtime home - everything the plugin manages
    ├── aphrodite.toml      ← proxy/engine config (written by `aphrodite setup`)
    ├── BINARY_VERSION      ← binary version pin (written by `aphrodite setup`)
    ├── binaries/
    │   ├── aphrodite       ← proxy binary (installed by `aphrodite setup`, download.sh, or built)
    │   └── libaphrodite_hermes.dylib   ← dylib the plugin loads (libaphrodite_hermes.so on Linux)
    ├── ccr.db              ← SQLite CCR store (created on first run)
    ├── directives/         ← active directive files
    └── logs/               ← proxy/engine logs
```

The plugin directory stays hooks-only: it carries just `plugin.yaml` and
the `__init__.py` loader that registers hooks/tools, and the plugin never
writes, downloads, or modifies anything inside it - every runtime artifact
(binaries, config, directives, CCR state, logs) lives in the runtime home
above. On plugin startup `layout_check.py` (shipped with the source
checkout) checks toward this schema; installed layouts are already canonical
because `aphrodite setup` produced them. Two proxy processes come up on
`:9797` (cache) and `:9798` (token) once Hermes launches the plugin (or once
you launch `aphrodite` yourself - see
[Troubleshooting](/docs/install/troubleshooting/#verify-the-proxy-without-hermes)).

## Uninstall

```bash
hermes plugins disable aphrodite
rm -rf ~/.hermes/plugins/aphrodite
pkill -f "aphrodite" 2> /dev/null || true # stop any proxy still running
```

Also remove `~/.hermes/aphrodite/` to fully clean up the binaries, config,
CCR database, and logs that the download scripts or `aphrodite setup` wrote.
