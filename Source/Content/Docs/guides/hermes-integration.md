# Hermes Integration

Aphrodite connects to Hermes Agent as a native plugin, not as a proxy you
point a client at. The plugin is a thin Python loader: it registers six
hooks, thirteen tools, and an optional context engine with Hermes, then
forwards every call into a Rust dylib that holds all of the actual behavior.
Two proxy processes - a cache proxy and a token proxy - run alongside as
subprocesses, and a canonical runtime home under `~/.hermes/aphrodite/`
holds the binaries, config, CCR database, directives, and logs.

## The plugin is a pure loader

The plugin directory ships no binaries. It contains the loader
(`__init__.py`), the generated FFI bindings (`_bindings.py`), the download
scripts (`download.sh` / `download.ps1`), the layout checker
(`layout_check.py`, report-only), and `plugin.yaml`. All logic lives in
`libaphrodite_hermes.dylib`, which the loader resolves **once per process**
(no hot-reload) and smoke-tests in a subprocess before loading (a faulting
image degrades to a graceful "plugin disabled" instead of killing the
gateway).

Registration is driven by the dylib: the shim asks the dylib for its hook
names and tool schemas and registers one callback per name, so the hook set
and tool set are always registered together and a broken callback is
isolated without failing the others. `plugin.yaml` declares the same six
hooks and thirteen tools for Hermes' manifest.

## Hooks

Six hooks connect Aphrodite to the agent loop. Each is a thin dispatch that
forwards its arguments to the dylib and hands the JSON reply back to Hermes.

| Hook                        | When it fires                  | What Aphrodite does                                                         |
| --------------------------- | ------------------------------ | --------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| `on_session_start`          | A Hermes session starts        | Reset per-session state: turn counter, conversation index, markers, nudges  |
| `pre_tool_call`             | Before a tool executes         | Auto-background long-running calls; split chained commands (opt-in)         |
| `transform_tool_result`     | After every tool call          | Classify the result, compress above threshold, replace it with a CCR marker |
| `transform_terminal_output` | After every terminal execution | Same pipeline for shell stdout/stderr                                       |
| `pre_llm_call`              | Before each LLM request        | Inject directives, nudges, and the recall catalog under a hard byte budget  |
| `post_llm_call`             | After each LLM response        | Archive the turn, advance the counter, expire nudges and stale tasks        |

`transform_tool_result` is where tool output becomes a marker: the result is
classified into a content type, hashed (BLAKE3), stored, and replaced by a
marker of the form `<<<CCR:hash|type|size>>>` with a compact preview. The
agent can recover the exact original bytes with `aphrodite_retrieve`. See
[Plugin Hooks](/docs/plugin/hooks/) for the full per-hook reference.

## Tools

The plugin registers thirteen `aphrodite_*` tools from the dylib's schemas:
`retrieve`, `compress`, `stats`, `rebuild`, `files`, `diff`, `search`,
`directive`, `test`, `catalog`, `reclassify`, `prefetch`, and
`prefetch_status`. They teach the agent how to interact with the CCR engine -
retrieving stored content, inspecting the catalog, adjusting directives -
and are auto-expanded inline rather than compressed. See
[Tool Relay: Tools](/docs/tool-relay/tools/) for the reference.

## Context engine

The plugin declares context-engine support and can register a Hermes context
engine when opted in with `APHRODITE_CONTEXT_ENGINE=1`. By default no engine
is registered: the per-turn catalog summary is injected through the
`pre_llm_call` hook instead, so the context assembler remains the single
source of what the model sees. See
[Context Engine](/docs/plugin/context-engine/) for details.

## Runtime home

The canonical runtime home is `~/.hermes/aphrodite/`:

```
$HERMES_HOME/ (default ~/.hermes/)
├── plugins/
│   └── aphrodite/          ← Hermes-owned install location (symlink or dir)
└── aphrodite/              ← canonical runtime home
    ├── aphrodite.toml      ← engine and proxy config
    ├── binaries/           ← proxy binary + dylib (fetched by the explicit
    │                         download.sh / download.ps1 setup step)
    ├── ccr.db              ← SQLite CCR store (created on first run)
    ├── directives/         ← active directive files
    └── logs/               ← proxy and engine logs
```

On plugin startup `layout_check.py` checks toward this schema but is
**report-only**: deviations are logged, never moved - and the
`plugins/aphrodite` install path is Hermes-owned (the plugin never creates
or recreates it). The plugin directory stays a pure loader.

## Proxy subprocesses

Two proxies launch when the plugin loads: a cache proxy on `:9797`
(in-memory backend, compresses payloads above 8 KB) and a token proxy on
`:9798` (SQLite backend, compresses above 1 KB). Launch is guarded - the
plugin probes both health endpoints first and skips launching when a healthy
proxy already owns the ports, and `APHRODITE_NO_AUTO_LAUNCH` disables
auto-launch entirely. Each proxy compresses HTTP response bodies for
OpenAI-compatible clients; the Hermes plugin path compresses locally through
the hooks and does not depend on the proxies for its own compression.

## Why not just a proxy?

A generic proxy compresses HTTP response bodies. That helps, but:

1. **Tool output never hits the wire.** Hermes tool calls run locally.
   `transform_tool_result` intercepts the return value before it becomes
   part of the message history. A proxy cannot see this.
2. **Terminal output is local.** `transform_terminal_output` catches shell
   command stdout/stderr before Hermes processes it. The proxy has no
   visibility.
3. **The agent is augmented, not just compressed.** The thirteen
   `aphrodite_*` tools teach the agent how to use the CCR engine, and
   `pre_llm_call` injects directives, nudges, and the recall catalog. A
   proxy is opaque - the agent does not know compression exists.

| Setup                   | `hermes plugins enable aphrodite`              | `OPENAI_BASE_URL=http://localhost:9798` |

## What the agent sees

Without Aphrodite, the agent's context fills with raw tool output:

```
500 tokens of build output... scrolling... error? no... warning? no...
ok it passed. That was 500 tokens I'll never get back.
```

With native Hermes integration, `transform_tool_result` replaces it:

```
[build:0E 0W 1L]  ← a few tokens. The agent knows: build passed.
```

The agent retrieves the full output with `aphrodite_retrieve(hash)` only
when it actually needs it - for clean builds, exit=0 terminals, and small
diffs, the preview is enough.

## Setup

There are three install paths - the Hermes plugin with an explicit
`download.sh` / `download.ps1` setup step (recommended), `cargo install
aphrodite` + `aphrodite setup`, and building from source. See [Installing Aphrodite](/docs/install/) for the full
walkthrough and per-platform details. Short version for the plugin path:

```bash
git clone https://github.com/PlayForm/Aphrodite-Hermes.git
ln -s "$(pwd)/Aphrodite-Hermes" ~/.hermes/plugins/aphrodite
hermes plugins enable aphrodite
hermes # restart so the plugin loads fresh
```

Before enabling the plugin, run the explicit setup step - `bash
download.sh` (or `pwsh ./download.ps1` on Windows) - which fetches the
binary + dylib into `~/.hermes/aphrodite/binaries/`, SHA-256 verified
against the in-tree `SHA256SUMS.txt`. `register()` never downloads: if the
binaries are missing it logs the setup command and the plugin stays
disabled until they are present. No Rust toolchain needed.
